            <p>In the past, lust was categorized as one of the seven capital vices, i.e. one of the <a class="site-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins" target="blank">seven deadly sins</a>. However, in contemporary language it seems that lust is now simply equated with sexual desire. I think that this is a mistake, and a mistake that matters. This distinction has nothing to do with religious prudery, but rather with the place of sexual desire in a fulfilled human life. Religion and sex don&#39;t have the best track record, in many ways. And yet in a recent survey religious individuals reported high levels of satisfaction regarding sex. Even the medieval philosopher and theologian <a class="site-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas" target="blank">Saint Thomas Aquinas</a> believed that sexual intercourse would have been more pleasurable in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of humanity than it is now.</p>

            <p>Setting particularly religious views aside, is there a way to distinguish between sexual desire and lust that will be helpful? The difference is that sexual desire, in its proper place and expression, is a vital and good part of our humanity. In lust, however, we fail to respect our own dignity and the dignity of our partner.</p>
    
            <p>Consider the following definition of lust:</hp>
            <blockquote>Lust&#8230;pretends sex and sexual pleasure are a party for one. Lust makes sexual pleasure all about me. It is a self-gratification project. This feature of lust more than any other puts it in opposition to well-ordered sexual enjoyment. In lust, sexual pleasure is divorced from mutual self-giving...I wantmy pleasure, says the lustful one, and I want it now. (Glittering Vices, p. 164)</blockquote>
    
            <p>Simply stated, lust is the excessive desire for one&#39;s own sexual pleasure. The point is not that desire for such pleasure is wrong, but rather that at its best sexual intercourse is an act of mutual self-giving and even sacrifice, rather than mere mutual masturbation. Non-lustful sexual desire includes a desire for one&#39;s own pleasure, but also a desire for the pleasure of the other. It also includes a desire for him or her as a person and not a mere body to be used for one's own purposes. Sex is not merely recreation, it is also a means of the unification of two people, in both body and spirit. In this way, sex can express and foster a meaningful unity and harmony between human beings. The desire for this type of human relationship is good and preferable to the self-centeredness of and ultimate dissatisfaction produced by mere lust.</p>
