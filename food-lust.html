            <p>Some people are into cute cat photos, others find dancing toddlers appealing but it's obvious what the common theme on my newsfeed is - food.</p>
    
            <p>I love food. I love its aroma, the presentation and definitely the eating.
I could spend hours trawling through photos of edible delicacies salivating over a perfectly cooked steak sliced and gleaming in its juices, chocolate brownies with decadent caramel sauce oozing from its crevices. And bacon ... mmm, bacon.</p>

            <p>I don&#39;t discriminate, I have a deep affection for cuisines from all over the world. I admire dishes that I can't even pronounce.</p>

            <p>And it seems I&#39;m not alone. Food lust is shared among millions who are devout followers and contributors of Facebook pages and Instagram hastags such as Food Porn, #lovefood, Foodspotting, Chowhound and FoodCandy.</p>

            <p>An article in the New York Times took note of the growing phenomenon where diners woul       d reach for their phones before their cutlery.</p>

            <p>According to photo-sharing website Flickr&#39;s marketing director, Tara Kirchner, the number of pictures tagged "food" had increased to more than six million in two years. The hashtag <a class="site-link" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23food&src=typd" target="blank">#food</a> on Twitter has been used in more than 128 million posts to date.</p>
    
            <p>This admiration doesn&#39;t come without its detractors. There would be an equal amount of online users who would subscribe to the mentality of the Facebook page, <a class="site-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/STOP-TAKING-PICTURES-OF-YOUR-FOOD-JUST-EAT-IT/119933279994" target="blank">&#8220;Stop taking photos, just eat it&#8221;</a>. There&#39;s also confusion as to why there's no desire in wanting to learn how these meals are made.</p>

            <p>But for me, it&#39;s very simple. Sit back, admire and enjoy the visual feast.</p>
