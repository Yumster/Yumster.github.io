            <p>Her unruly red-blond hair tufting atop her head, Deidrah sat beside Oppenheim. She lipped his ear. She mouthed his chest. She kissed his belly over and over, lips lingering with each kiss. After a while, he pulled himself up and strolled away from her attentions, glancing back over his shoulder to see if she was following. She was.</p>
        
            <p>Deidrah, probably the most reserved female monkey in the compound, started in again on his white-haired torso as they sat together on a concrete curb. The habitat, a 120-foot square, was filled with ladders and ropes and assorted apparatus donated by a fire department and by McDonald&#39;s; an environment of trees and vines would have been too expensive to create and maintain. A trio of monkey children sprinted toward a tube, disappeared inside it, burst from the other end and raced around for another run-through, berserk with joy.</p>
    
            <p>From a platform on a steel tower, <a class="site-link" href="http://www.psychology.emory.edu/nab/wallen/" target="blank">Kim Wallen</a>, an Emory University psychologist and neuroendocrinologist who has been working for decades at the university&#39;s <a class="site-link" href="http://www.yerkes.emory.edu/" target="blank">Yerkes Primate Research Center</a> outside Atlanta, gazed down at the habitat&#39;s 75 rhesus monkeys. This is the species that was sent into orbit in the &#39;50s and &#39;60s as stand-ins for humans to see if we would survive trips to the moon.</p>
        
            <p>&#8220;Females were passive. That was the theory in the middle &#39;70s. That was the wisdom,&#8221; he remembered from the start of his career. Deidrah&#39;s face, always a bit redder than most, was luminous this morning, lit scarlet with lust as she lifted it from Oppenheim&#39;s chest. &#8220;The prevailing model was that female hormones affected female pheromones &#8212; affected the female&#39;s smell, her attractivity to the male. The male initiated all sexual behavior.&#8221; But what science had managed to miss in the monkeys &#8212; and what Wallen and a few others were now studying &#8212; was female desire.</p>

            <h2>Long-held biases about lust</h2>
            <p>What mostly male scientists had expected, and likely wanted to see, appeared to have blinded them. Wallen&#39;s career had been about pulling away the blinders. My visit to Yerkes was part of seven years of reporting about the science of women&#39;s sexuality, a field that has only begun to look beyond the stereotype of long-held distortions about female lust and monogamy that Wallen was describing. Wallen and his primates helped to put things in focus.</p>
    
            <p>At the moment, below us, one female clawed fiercely at another, bit into a leg, whipped the weaker one back and forth like a weightless doll. Harrowing shrieks rose up. Four or five more monkeys joined in, attacking the one, who escaped somehow, sped away, was caught again. The shrieks grew more plaintive, more piercing, the attackers piling on, apparently for the kill, then desisting inexplicably. Assaults like this flared often; Wallen and his team usually couldn&#39;t glean the reasons. Full battle &#8212; one female-led family&#39;s attempt to overthrow another &#8212; was very rare. That tended toward death: death from wounds and, some veterinarians thought, from sheer fright and shock. Occasionally the compound was littered with corpses.</p>
    
            <p>When he thought about the way science had somehow kept itself oblivious to female monkey lust for so long, Wallen blamed not only preconceptions but the sex act itself. &#8220;When you look at the sexual interaction, it&#39;s easy to see what the male is doing; he&#39;s thrusting. It takes really focusing on the entire interaction to see all that the female is doing &#8212; and once you truly see it, you can never overlook it again.&#8221;</p>
    
            <p>Deidrah fingered Oppenheim&#39;s belly, caressing, desperate to win his favors. He flopped down on his front, inert in a strip of sun. She kissed where she could get access, his ear again. The red of her face bordered on neon.
Bulky and torpid, Oppenheim and the habitat&#39;s other adult male didn&#39;t fully take part in the life of the compound. They didn&#39;t belong to any particular family. They were merely breeders &#8212; and their peripheral status mimicked the male rhesus role in the wild. There, in Asian mountains or lowland forests, adult males lurked at the edges of female-run domains. The females invited them in to serve sexually. The males remained &#8212; desirable, dispensable &#8212; until the females lost interest in them. Then they were dismissed, replaced. In his compounds, Wallen removed the breeders and introduced new males about every three years, the time it took for their charms to wane, for the frequency of their copulations &#8212; almost always female-initiated &#8212; to fade. In the wild they seemed to stay attractive only slightly longer.</p>
    
            <h5>A bias toward novelty</h5>
            <blockquote>&#8220;Rhesus females are very xenophobic when it comes to other females,&#8221;</blockquote> 
            <p class="quote">Wallen said.</p>
            <blockquote>&#8220;Introduce a new female into the compound and she&#39;ll be hounded until she dies. But when it comes to males, females have a bias toward novelty.&#8221;</blockquote>
