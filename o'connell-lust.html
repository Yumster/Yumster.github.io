            <p>Lust has no morals. She had once found herself between two married men. Colleagues. Both Italian. Both old enough to have raised her. To have spanked her naughty bare bottom. The bar they lurked in was dark. Candles painted desire&#39;s shadow on the wall as they both vied for her attention. A dangerous competition as fantasy morphed into reality. They stroked her cheek. Mimicked some kind of love. Or at the very least, adoration. The two gold bands on their misbehaving fingers tried to catch the light. To blind them all. To stop the immoralities. But temptation, temptation was a warrior. Its armour was oiled with pheromones. Dripping with the sweet scent of orgasms. Slick with ecstasy. Soaked with scotch. So much scotch.</p>
    
            <p>A kiss on her hand resulted in a finger between lips. Her finger. His lips. Not those lips. His groans were primal. Passed down from the echoing caves of our ancestors. As she dipped in and out with the index of her hand, the other looked on with that vermin named envy slashing and axing lines between his eyes. His trousers dropped several sizes around his groin under the table.</p>

            <p>When one Italian left, the other staked claim. Kissed her lips. And again. And again. Trying to fulfill an insatiable appetite his wife couldn&#39;t scratch. It was the closest she came to tasting love &#8212; when she was with a married man. His wife&#39;s monogamously musky scent on his skin. Love. Second hand love. As deadly as second hand smoke if inhaled too deeply for too long.</p>
    
            <p>Lust was unpredictable. Her lust had its big bang somewhere between 1992 and 1994. She didn&#39;t know its name at the time. Only that it was hungry. The feelings that ricocheted around her small, still crystalizing body were overwhelming. She couldn&#39;t keep track of her longings. One minute her stares were directed at Steve, a skater addicted to detention, and the next she was focused on Cory, still keen on hair gel and popped collars. And then there was Alex. Brad. Chris. Duncan. Eric. Frank. Geoff. And so on and so forth. All the way to the letter Z. For Zubin. He was exotic. He had eyes as deep as a well. She had wanted to rappel into them and taste his water.</p>
            <p>There were no boundaries to her teenage obsessions. Her Tiger Beat hormones diseased her with unrequited lust. It was only in later years that cravings were reciprocated. She learned to focus her desires. But never tamed. Lust is wild. Liable to lash out when caged.</p>
    
            <p>Lust doesn&#39;t travel by map. It appeared on an airplane once, thousands of miles above the ground, with the stranger sitting next to her. His lashes caught the light of the setting sun on the horizon sending it out like lasers. A mesmerizing kaleidoscope of orange and pink and red. His knee nudged hers under the blankets. No words. No verbal communication. Chemistry bubbled and smoked through the eyes and out of their pores. There was only one shared look to stamp their passports with approval before hands made the coarse blankets move like sand dunes in the Sahara. The time zone was irrelevant.</p>
    
            <p>Lust doesn&#39;t care for age. It happened on a picnic table at her sister&#39;s wedding. When a something-in-law lifted her taffeta skirts over her head giving the man in the moon a hard on. He was young. She was not. His limbs and extremities did things a 21 year old shouldn&#39;t be privy to. He was top of his carnal class. Presented with as many gold stars as there were in that night sky. It was almost dawn when she, fifteen years older than his darting tongue, snuck back into her family&#39;s cottage. Tiptoeing so her lust wouldn&#39;t be found out. Exposed as a harlot. Lust can be sneaky.
Lust has no schedule. Elevators. Supermarket lineups. 2pm. 4am. Time and location don&#39;t matter. Lust is a lightning bolt striking a jagged tear in her libido. Oozing red innards across reason. Unreliable. Spontaneous. But she couldn&#39;t break up with lust. She was addicted.</p>

            <p>Her lust has no prejudice. She would drag her nail lightly across a bare thigh on a crowded dance floor. Slowly. Just to touch flesh. A beating being. She mainly tussled with men. But appreciated women. Women were a different flavour. Cotton candy. Cherry cola. Chocolate kisses. It was a delicacy she saved for special occasions. A gift for her lust. Not a sacrifice. There was nothing sacrificial about the pleasure she derived from lip to lip contact. One pair horizontal, the other vertical.</p>
    
            <blockquote>Often, lust was an hors d&#39;oeuvre. An amuse bouche. A quick fix. She didn&#39;t always touch lust with her hands. She liked to let it blow in her ear, carried to her by music. She watched it from afar, committed sins with her eyes. And she smelled it infused in a cologne, letting it climb up her olfactory fire escape.</blockquote>
    
            <p>If supressed for too long though, lust strangles. Literally. There was one instance after 47 days of dormancy when a seatbelt firmly held her neck in place, against the car door frame, as lips pressed urgently against hers. Her hair got trapped in the strap, forming a curtain to her lips that his tongue deftly parted, strands of brunette getting caught between her teeth. A street lamp discretely illuminated the passion. Lust had ended it there when the man played his game of power and left her with a bruised neck and wanting so much more. Lust had teased her that night under the cloak of the Hollywood Hills. Given her a ravenous taste before yanking the carrot away, into the grey clouds. Silver lining unseen.</p>
    
            <p class="emphasis">Lust was an asshole.</p>
            <p class="emphasis">She&#39;d always loved assholes.</p>           
            <p class="emphasis">Scratch that, liked assholes.</p>
    
            <p>Love wasn&#39;t her brand of desire. Didn&#39;t care for it. She would spit it out when it accidentally touched her taste buds. It was the one juice she wouldn&#39;t swallow. Lust was her choice. Lust was her lifestyle.</p>
